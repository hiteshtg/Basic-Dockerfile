* 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a basic Dockerfile to help beginners understand the fundamentals of Docker. The project demonstrates:

- Creating a Dockerfile
- Building a Docker image
- Running a container from the image

* 🌐 Project URL

- [[https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-dockerfile][Roadmap Project Page]]

* 📁 Repository Contents

#+begin_src
.
├── Dockerfile
└── README.md
#+end_src

_Note: The application code should be placed in this directory if needed._

* 🐳 Prerequisites

- [[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/][Docker]] installed on your machine

* 🛠️ Build the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, run the following command in the repository's root directory:

#+begin_src bash
docker build -t basic-dockerfile .
#+end_src

This command creates an image named =basic-dockerfile=.

* ▶️ Run the Docker Container

To run the container based on the image you built:

#+begin_src bash
docker run basic-dockerfile
#+end_src

If your Dockerfile includes exposed ports or specific commands (like running a server), you may want to use:

#+begin_src bash
docker run -p 8080:80 basic-dockerfile
#+end_src

Replace =8080:80= with appropriate port mappings as needed.

* 📌 Notes

- This is a minimal example intended for educational purposes.
- Feel free to extend it with your own application code, entrypoints, and dependencies.
